The fact that he honestly approached her with his intentions, that he put his nuts on the chopping block and made himself vulnerable to her immediately, actually sub-communicates True Confidence and attractiveness in itself. And on top of that it shows desire for her, which is going to trigger her arousal. Remember: what you actually say doesn’t matter; WHY you say it matters.

“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked. “The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. It’s self-inflicted fear and ignorance that keep people trapped. So you boys go to school and get your college degrees, and I’ll teach you how to stay out of the trap.”

This may sound absurdly simple, but most people have no idea how profound this rule is.

The process repeats itself: Higher incomes cause higher taxes, also called “bracket creep.” A credit card comes in the mail. They use it and max it out. A loan company calls and says their greatest “asset,” their home, has appreciated in value. Because their credit is so good, the company offers a billconsolidation loan and tells them the intelligent thing to do is clear off the high-interest consumer debt by paying off their credit card. And besides, interest on their home is a tax deduction.

As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers: the power of the sword, the jewel, and the mirror. The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of dollars on weapons and, because of this, is a powerful military presence in the world. The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to the saying, “Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This selfknowledge, according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured of the three.

As an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts are generally as follows: 1. You work for the company. Employees make their business owner or the shareholders rich, not themselves. Your efforts and success will help provide for the owner’s success and retirement. 2. You work for the government. The government takes its share from your paycheck before you even see it. By working harder, you simply increase the amount of taxes taken by the government. Most people work from January to May just for the government. 3. You work for the bank.

Known as Hebb’s Law, this principle helps explain how we remember anything. Take my first memory of cookies. I spent ten minutes waiting in front of the oven, bathed in radiating heat and the scent of butter, flour, and sugar. I waited until they came out of the oven and watched the steam rise up off of them as they cooled. When I could bear no more, my father gave me a glass of milk, I grabbed a cookie, and I learned empathy for my poor blue friend from Sesame Street. My neural network for cookies involves sight, smell, and taste. There are audio components—the sound of the word cookie and the sound of milk pouring into a glass. I remember my dad’s face smiling as he bit into his own delicious cookie. This first cookie experience was a parade of sensations, which wired together into a tight web of neural connections. These connections enable me to return to my past whenever I encounter a new cookie. Faced with a familiar buttery scent, that old web of neurons reactivates; my brain plays back the same sights, sounds, emotions, and tastes, and I relive my childhood experience.

There is only one prerequisite to learning a new pattern: we need to notice it when it passes by. We can do this in many ways—we could listen to recordings of every new word we read, for example—but the best way to do this involves a phonetic alphabet. This is not to say that recordings aren’t helpful. I think they’re great (necessary, even)! It’s just that sometimes we need to be told what we’re hearing before we can truly hear it. We’ve already encountered one good phonetic alphabet— the IPA—but the particular alphabet is less important than the information it conveys. Hell, you can use “bawn-JURE” if you know exactly what that would sound like in a French person’s mouth.— We’re looking for a way to see what we’re hearing and, equally important, what we’re not hearing.

And the answer is illuminating: grammar is a mirror to ourselves. It is a living history of our desire to make sense of our words. In English, we’re currently turning sneaked into snuck. To many ears, snuck seems to “sound better,” but that’s not why we’re doing it. We’re doing it because it makes two nonsensical verbs— stuck and struck —seem a little less nonsensical. We did this to catched several hundred years ago, putting it into a group with taught, bought, and thought, and we’ll probably turn “dragged” into “drug” before the next century is up. We like to have groups of words that follow patterns, even when those patterns—our irregular verbs, in this case—don’t really make sense.

I want you to imagine all of the masculine nouns exploding. Your tree? Kaboom, splinters of wood everywhere. A branch gets embedded in the wall behind you. Dog chunks splatter all over the ceiling and floors. You wipe bits of fur and gore from your forehead. Make your images as vivid as you can stomach. Feminine nouns should catch fire. Your nose spews fire out of it like a dragon, a flaming cat sets fire to your bedroom Feel the heat of each image; the more senses you can involve, the better. Neuter items should shatter like glass. Jagged, brown-red, sparkling shards of horse spread across the floor, as does your broken heart (sniff). Take a moment to imagine the remaining images yourself: an exploding mouth and neck (masculine), a burning hand and tree bud (feminine), a shattering leaf and knee (neuter).

• Many languages assign a nonsensical grammatical gender to each of their nouns, which is a standard source of trouble for language learners. • If your language has grammatical gender, you can memorize it easily if you assign each gender a particularly vivid action and then imagine each of your nouns performing that action.

1. Put оn ѕоmе grеаt muѕіс аnd dance! FEEL thе muѕіс іn your bоdу and mоvе wіth іt. If it dоеѕn't gеt you gоіng right аwау, hang in thеrе and fаkе іt. It соuld tаkе уоu a fеw mоmеntѕ tо gеt out оf уоur hеаd аnd thе wоrld of уоur еgо аnd drор іntо уоur bоdу, but dоn't gіvе up.

Wаtсh a funny or rоmаntіс movie. Tаkе a brеаk frоm your оwn drаmа аnd replace іt with ѕоmеthіng thаt fееlѕ gооd. 3. Stор wаtсhіng аnd reading thе nеwѕ. I stopped following thе news аftеr 9/11.

If there is ѕоmеthіng going on in thе wоrld that уоu nееd to know, I promise уоu will find оut. 4. Surround уоurѕеlf wіth mеmоrіеѕ аnd thоughtѕ оf what уоu love.

Wаtсhіng a ѕunrіѕе or ѕunѕеt аlwауѕ tаkеѕ mу brеаth аwау. 9. Thіnk оf thе things уоu are grateful fоr. Evеn іn уоur dаrkеѕt moments, there іѕ always ѕоmеthіng tо be grateful fоr. Bеіng able to walk, hаvіng a rооf оvеr уоur hеаd, a bеd tо ѕlеер оn, just bеіng аlіvе... Oftеn іt'ѕ nоt until оnе of thеѕе things іѕ tаkеn аwау оr іѕ іn jeopardy that wе аррrесіаtе what wе have.

Sеvеrаl рrоblеmѕ аnd сrіѕеѕ аrіѕе аѕ rеѕultѕ оf іnсоrrесt decisions or іmрulѕіvе behavior. So if you want tо lеѕѕеn the rіѕk of facing a сrіѕіѕ, уоu nееd to make уоur dесіѕіоnѕ carefully. Whеn making dесіѕіоnѕ, mаkе sure tо сhесk all ѕіdеѕ оf thе іѕѕuе аnd соnѕіdеr all роѕѕіblе оutсоmеѕ ѕо уоu can соmраrе which dіrесtіоn goes thе best wау. If уоu fіnd it difficult to соntrоl уоur decision-making аnd your іmрulѕеѕ, thеn уоu hаvе tо gо deeper. Yоur соnѕсіоuѕ mind may not bе thе рrоblеm. Pеrhарѕ the problem lіеѕ іn уоur subconscious. If your ѕubсоnѕсіоuѕ іѕ not рrоgrаmmеd tо think and mаkе dесіѕіоnѕ uѕіng a саrеfullу outlined process, thеn уоu аrе likely to mаkе dесіѕіоnѕ without rеаllу thinking about іt.

Whenever I do my talks, I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise. No. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you want to build an empire. The more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required, or the house comes tumbling down. This is the left brain side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business. No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side. No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know the “technical” aspects of the market, which is emotion driven; the Tickle Me Elmo doll during Christmas 1996 is a case of a technical or emotion-driven market. The other market factor is the “fundamental” or the economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not make sense based on the current market conditions

Many people think the concepts of investing and understanding the market are too complex for kids. They fail to see that kids know those subjects intuitively. For those not familiar with the Elmo doll, it was a Sesame Street character that was highly touted to the kids just before Christmas. Most all kids wanted one, and put it at the top of their Christmas list. Many parents wondered if the company intentionally held the product off the market, while continuing to advertise it for Christmas. A panic set in due to high demand and lack of supply. Having no dolls to buy in the stores, scalpers saw an opportunity to make a small fortune from desperate parents. The unlucky parents who did not find a doll were forced to buy another toy for Christmas. The incredible popularity of the Tickle

1. Tax advantages: A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is so exciting, but not necessary to get into unless you have sizable assets or a business. Employees earn and get taxed and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It's one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They're easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For example; by owning your own corporation - vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre-tax dollars

2. Protection from lawsuits. We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of your action. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to protect their assets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met with layers of legal protection, and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. They control everything, but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich. They learned it from the Robin Hood story.

In my classes I strongly urge students to learn to take • risks, to be bold, to let their genius convert that fear into power and brilliance. It works for some and just terrifies others. I have come to realize that for most people, when it comes to the subject of money, they would rather play it safe. I have had to field questions such as: Why take risks?

So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that but you. Yet, I can tell you why I myself do it. I do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive. I'd rather be welcoming change than dreading change. I'd rather be excited about making millions than worrying about not getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most exciting time, unprecedented in our world's history. Generations from now, people will look back at this period of time and remark at what an exciting era it must have been. It was the death of the old and birth of the new. It was full of turmoil and it was exciting. So why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do, you will prosper greatly. And if you don't, this period of time will be a frightening one. It will be a time of watching people move boldly forward while others cling to decaying life rings.

At least she gave me a fair and favorable write-up the next morning. The world is filled with smart, talented, educated and gifted people. We meet them every day. They are all around us. A few days ago, my car was not running well. I pulled into a garage, and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes. He knew what was wrong by simply listening to the engine. I was amazed. The sad truth is, great talent is not enough. I am constantly shocked at how little talented people earn. I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn more than $100,000 a year. I have met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than $20,000 a year. A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors, dentists and chiropractors struggle financially. All this time, I thought that when they graduated, the dollars would pour in. It was this business consultant who gave me the phrase, “They are one skill away from great wealth.”

In school and in the workplace, the popular opinion is the idea of “specialization.” That is, in order to make more money or get promoted, you need to “specialize.” That is why medical doctors immediately begin to seek a specialty such as orthopedics or pediatrics. The same is true for accountants, architects, lawyers, pilots and others. My educated dad believed in the same dogma. That is why he was thrilled when he eventually achieved his doctorate. He often admitted •;• that schools reward people who study more and more about less and less.

When you think about it, this makes sense. If, like those with the growth mindset, you believe you can develop yourself, then you’re open to accurate information about your current abilities, even if it’s unflattering. What’s more, if you’re oriented toward learning, as they are, you need accurate information about your current abilities in order to learn effectively. However, if everything is either good news or bad news about your precious traits—as it is with fixed-mindset people—distortion almost inevitably enters the picture. Some outcomes are magnified, others are explained away, and before you know it you don’t know yourself at all.

The subject of tidying ɹrst caught my attention when I was in junior high school. The catalyst was a book called The Art of Discarding by Nagisa Tatsumi (Takarajimasha, Inc.), which explained the importance of getting rid of unnecessary things. I picked the book up on my way home from school, intrigued to see a topic I had never encountered before, and I can still remember the shock of surprise I felt as I read it on the train. I became so absorbed that I almost missed my stop. Once home, I went straight to my room with a handful of garbage bags and stayed closeted for several hours. Although my room was small, by the time I ɹnished I had eight bags full of stuʃ—clothes I never wore, textbooks from elementary school, toys I had not played with in years, my eraser and seal collection. I had forgotten that most of these things even existed. I sat motionless on the ɻoor for about an hour afterward staring at the pile of bags and wondering, “Why on earth did I bother keeping all this stuʃ?”

Tidying in the end is just a physical act. The work involved can be broadly divided into two kinds: deciding whether or not to dispose of something and deciding where to put it. If you can do these two things, you can achieve perfection. Objects can be counted. All you need to do is look at each item, one at a time, and decide whether or not to keep it and where to put it. That’s all you need to do to complete this job. It is not hard to tidy up perfectly and completely in one fell swoop. In fact, anyone can do it. And if you want to avoid rebound, this is the only way to do it.

Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved. But sooner or later, all the storage units are full, the room once again overɻows with things, and some new and “easy” storage method becomes necessary, creating a negative spiral. This is why tidying must start with discarding. We need to exercise self-control and resist storing our belongings until we have ɹnished identifying what we really want and need to keep.

Tidying up by location is a fatal mistake. I’m ashamed to admit that it took me three years to see this. Many people are surprised to hear that such a seemingly viable approach is actually a common pitfall. The root of the problem lies in the fact that people often store the same type of item in more than one place. When we tidy each place separately, we fail to see that we’re repeating the same work in many locations and become locked into a vicious circle of tidying. To avoid this, I recommend tidying by category. For example, instead of deciding that today you’ll tidy a particular room, set goals like “clothes today, books tomorrow.

Using this approach, people who can’t stay tidy can be categorized into just three types: the “can’t-throw-it-away” type, the “can’t-put-it-back” type, and the “ɹrst-two-combined” type. Looking at my clients, I further realized that 90 percent fall into the third category—the “can’t-throw-it-away, can’t-put-it-back” type—while the remaining 10 percent fall into the “can’t-put-it-back” type. I have yet to ɹnd someone who is purely the “can’t throw it away” type, probably because anyone who can’t throw things away will soon end up with so much stuʃ that their storage space overɻows. As for the 10 percent who can discard but can’t put things away, when we start tidying seriously, it is soon obvious that they could discard much more because they produce at least thirty bags of garbage.

Therefore, what I say here applies only to my own method. Still, let me repeat: tidying should be done just once. Or, to put it more accurately, the work of tidying should be completed once and for all within a single period of time. If you think tidying is an endless chore that must be done every day, you are gravely mistaken. There are two types of tidying —“daily tidying” and “special event tidying.” Daily tidying, which consists of using something and putting it back in its place, will always be part of our lives as long as we need to use clothes, books, writing materials, and so on. But the purpose of this book is to inspire you to tackle the “special event” of putting your house in order as soon as possible.

begin by identifying your goal. There must have been some reason you picked up this book. What was it that motivated you to tidy in the ɹrst place? What do you hope to gain through tidying? Before you start getting rid of things, take the time to think this through carefully. This means visualizing the ideal lifestyle you dream of. If you skip this step, not only will it delay the whole process, but it will also put you at higher risk for rebound. Goals like “I want to live clutter-free” or “I want to be able to put things away” are too broad. You need to think much more deeply than that. Think in concrete terms so that you can vividly picture what it would be like to live in a clutter-free space.

The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they're not afraid of losing.

Don't get me wrong. It's probably a better portfolio than more than 70 percent of the population, and that's frightening. Because a safe portfolio is a lot better than no portfolio. It's a great portfolio for someone who loves safely. But playing it safe and going “balanced” on your investment portfolio is not the way successful investors play the game. If you have little money and you want to be rich, you must first be “focused,” not “balanced.” If you look at anyone successful, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress walking.

If you have any desire of being rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets. Do not do what poor and middle class people do: put their few eggs in many baskets. If you hate losing, play it safe. If losing makes you weak, play it safe. Go with balanced investments. If you're over 25 years old and are terrified of taking risks, don't change. Play it safe, but start early. Start accumulating your nest egg early because it will take time

So how do you beat laziness? The answer is a little greed. It's that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What's In It-For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What's in it for me if I'm healthy, sexy and good looking?” Or “What would my life be like if I never had to work again?” Or “What would I do if I had all the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to have something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire something better. We go to school and study hard because we want something better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is “What's in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It's the best cure for laziness. Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. But just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street. “Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: "Guilt is worse than greed. For guilt robs the body of its soul.“ And to me, Eleanor Roosevelt said it best: ”Do what you feel in your heart to be right-for you'll be criticized anyway.

The pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I've worked extra jobs, started other companies, traded in the stock market, anything just to make sure those guys don't start yelling at me. That pressure made me work harder, forced me to think, and all in all made me smarter and more active when it comes to money. If I had paid myself last, I would have felt no pressure, but I'd be broke.” “So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money I to that motivates you?” “That's right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are big bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these bullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of the 96?pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?”

To find million-dollar “deals of a lifetime” requires us to call on our financial genius. I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us. The problem is, our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called upon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that the love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future, our company or the government would take care of us when our working days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the same school system, who will end up paying for it. The message is still to work hard, earn money and spend it, and when we run short, we can always borrow more. Unfortunately, 90 percent of the Western world subscribes to the above dogma, simply because it's easier to find a job and work for money. If you are not one of the masses, I offer you the following ten steps to awaken your financial genius. I simply offer you the steps I have personally followed. If you want to follow some of them, great. If you don't, make up your own. Your financial genius is smart enough to develop its own list.

The road seems too long with too many hills to climb. It's easier to just work for money and hand the excess over to your broker.

A reason or a purpose is a combination of “wants” and “don't wants.” When people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich is, it is a combination of deep emotional “wants” and “don't wants.” I will list a few. First the “don't wants,” for they create the “wants.” I don't want to work all my life. I don't want what my parents aspired for, which was job security and a house in the suburbs. I don't like being an employee. I hated that my dad always missed my football games because he was so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked hard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for at his death. He could not even pass on what he worked so hard for when he died. The rich don't do that. They work hard and pass it on to their children. Now the wants. I want to be free to travel the world and live in the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want to simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want money to work for me. Those are my deep-seated, emotional reasons. What are yours? If they are not strong enough, then the reality of the road ahead may be greater than your reasons. I have lost money and been set back many times, but it was the deep emotional reasons that kept me standing up and going forward. I wanted to be free by age 40, but it took me until I was 4? with many learning experiences along the way.

And I can hear all the “responsible” people who pay their bills on time. I am not saying be irresponsible and not pay your bills. All I am saying is do what the book says, which is “pay yourself first.” And the diagram above is the correct accounting picture of that action. Not the one that follows.

There have been months in my life, when for whatever reason, cash flow was far less than my bills. I still paid myself first. My accountant and bookkeeper screamed in panic. “They're going to come after you. The IRS is going to put you in jail.” “You're going to ruin your credit rating.” “They'll cut off the electricity.” I still paid myself first.

The power of self-discipline and the power of internal fortitude. “Guts,” in less elegant terms. As my rich dad taught me the first month I worked for him, most people allow the world to push them around. A bill collector calls and you “pay or else.” So you pay and not pay yourself. A sales clerk says, “Oh, just put it on your charge card.” Your real estate agent tells you to “go ahead-the government allows you a tax deduction on your home.” That is what the book is really about. Having the guts to go against the tide and get rich. You may not be weak, but when it comes to money, many people get wimpy

. I let the creditors and even the government scream. I like it when they get tough. Why? Because those guys do me a favor. They inspire me to i go out and create more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money, and let the creditors yell. I generally pay them right away anyway. My wife and I have excellent credit. We just don't cave into the pressure and spend our savings or liquidate stocks to pay for consumer debt. That is not too financially intelligent.

. Don't get into large debt positions that you have to pay for. Keep your expenses low. Build up assets first. Then, buy the big house or nice car. Being stuck in the rat race is not intelligent. 2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and don't dip into your savings or investments. Use the pressure to inspire your financial genius to come up with new ways of making more money and then pay your bills. You will have increased your ability to make more money as well as your financial intelligence. ; : So many times I have gotten into financial hot water, and used my brain to create more income, while staunchly defending the assets in my asset column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I was like a good trooper defending the fort, Fort Assets. Poor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently called “Dipping into savings.” The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills. I know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you're not tough inside, the world will always push you around anyway. If you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works for you. A good one is to cut expenses, put your money in the bank, pay more than your fair share of income tax, buy safe mutual funds and take the vow of the average. But this violates the “pay yourself first” rule. The rule does not encourage self-sacrifice or financial abstinence. It doesn't mean pay yourself first and starve. Life was meant to be enjoyed. If you call on your financial genius, you can have all the goodies of life, get rich and pay bills, without sacrificing the good life. And that is financial intelligence.

A good broker saves me time in addition to making me money-as when I bought the piece of vacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately for over $25,000, so I could buy my Porsche quicker. A broker is your eyes and ears to the market. They're there every day so I do not have to be. I'd rather play golf. Also, people who sell their house on their own must not value their time much. Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that time to make more money or spend it with those I love? What I find funny is that so many poor and middle class people insist on tipping restaurant help 15 to 20 percent even for bad service and complain about paying a broker 3 to 7 percent. They enjoy tipping people in the expense column and stiffing people in the asset column. That is not financially intelligent

Unfortunately, most brokers are only salespeople. I would say the real estate salespeople are the worst. They sell, but they themselves own little or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference between a broker who sells houses and a broker who sells investments. And that is true for stock, bond, mutual fund and insurance brokers who call themselves financial planners. As in the fairy tale, you kiss a lot of frogs to find one prince. Just remember the old saying, “Never ask an encyclopedia salesperson if you need an encyclopedia.”

For example, if a settler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it for a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back. The Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not want to give it back. That is where the term “Indian giver” came from. A simple cultural misunderstanding. In the world of the “asset column,” being an Indian giver is vital to wealth. The sophisticated investor's first question is, “How fast do I get my money back?” They also want to know what they get for free, also called a piece of the action.

The power of myth. When I was a kid, I greatly admired Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Yogi Berra. They were my heroes. As a kid playing Little League, I wanted to be just like them. I treasured their baseball cards. I wanted to know everything about them. I knew the stats, the RBI, the ERAs, their batting averages, how much they got paid, and how they came up 1 from the minors. I wanted to know everything because I wanted to be just like them. Every time, as a 9 or 10 year-old kid, when I stepped up to bat or played first base or catcher, I wasn't me. I was Yogi or Hank. It's one of the most powerful ways we learn that we often lose as adults. We lose our heroes. We lose our naivete. Today, I watch young kids playing basketball near my home. On the court they're not little Johnny; they're Michael Jordan, Sir Charles or Clyde. Copying or emulating heroes is true power learning. And that is why when someone like O.J. Simpson falls from grace, there is such a huge outcry. There is more than just a courtroom trial. It is the loss of a hero. Someone people grew up with, looked up to, and wanted to be like. Suddenly we need to rid ourselves of that person.

Or when analyzing a trend, I look at it as though Peter Lynch were doing it. By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw genius. But heroes do more than simply inspire us. Heroes make things look easy. It's the making it look easy that convinces us to want to be just like them. “If they can do it, so can I.” When it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard. Instead find heroes who make it look easy

The power of giving. Both of my dads were teachers. My rich dad taught me a lesson I have carried all my life, and that was the necessity of being charitable or giving. My educated dad gave a lot by the way of time and knowledge, but almost never gave away money. As I said, he usually said that he would give when he had some extra money. Of course, there was rarely any extra. My rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly in tithing. “If you want something, you first need to give,” he would always say. When he was short of money, he simply gave money to his church or to his favorite charity. If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel “short” or in “need” of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, friendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do, but; it has always worked for me. I just trust that the principle of reciprocity it is true, and I give what I want. I want money, so I give money, and it comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help someone else sell something, and sales come to me. I want contacts and I help someone else get contacts, and like magic, contacts come to me. I heard a saying years ago that went, “God does not need to receive, but humans need to give.”

Stop doing what you're doing. In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Stop doing what is not working and look for something new to do. Look for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and look for books on different and unique subjects. I call them formulas. I buy how-to books on a formula I know nothing about. For example, it was in the bookstore that I found the book The 16 Percent Solution, by Joel Moskowitz.

Again, he asked me what I thought, and I naturally said sell, on a 1031 taxdeferred exchange. Suddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another friend in Austin, Texas who then moved this tax deferred money into a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began receiving checks for a little less than a $1,000 a month in income which he then poured back into the college mutual fund that was now building much faster. In 1996, the mini-warehouse sold and he received a check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale which was again rolled into a new project that would now throw off over $3,000 a month in income, again, going into the college mutual fund. He is now very confident that his goal of $400,000 will be met easily, and it only took $7,000 to start and a little financial intelligence.

Education and wisdom about money are important. Start early. Buy a book. Go to a seminar. Practice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash into a $1 million dollar asset producing $5,000 a month cash flow in less than six years. But I started learning as a kid. I encourage you to learn because it's not that hard. In fact, it's kind of easy once you get the hang of it. I think I have made my message clear. It's what is in your head that determines what is in your hands. Money is only an idea. There is a great book called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not Work Hard and Grow Rich. Learn to have money work hard for you and your life will be easier and happier. Today, don't play it safe, play it smart.

Many of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up to you to do what you please with both. With each dollar bill that enters your hand, you and only you have the power to determine your destiny. Spend it foolishly, you choose to be poor. Spend it on liabilities, you join the middle class. Invest it in your mind and learn how to acquire assets and you will be choosing wealth as your goal and your future. The choice is yours and only yours. Every day with every dollar, you decide to be rich, poor or middle class.

My spiritual education led me to my path in life. It seems that our paths in life are not found in our minds. Our path in life is to find out what is in our hearts. This does not mean a person cannot find their path in traditional education. I am sure many do. I am just saying that I doubt I would have found my path in traditional school

Step Two: Write it down. Think on paper. When you write your goal down, you crystallize it and give it tangible form. You create something that you can touch and see. On the other hand, a goal or objective that is not in writing is merely a wish or a fantasy. It has no energy behind it. Unwritten goals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection and numerous mistakes

Step Three: Set a deadline on your goal. Set sub-deadlines if necessary. A goal or decision without a deadline has no urgency. It has no real beginning or end. Without a definite deadline accompanied by the assignment or acceptance of specific responsibilities for completion, you will naturally procrastinate and get very little done

Step Four: Make a list of everything that you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal. As you think of new activities, add them to your list. Keep building your list until it is complete. A list gives you a visual picture of the larger task or objective. It gives you a track to run on. It dramatically increases the likelihood that you will achieve your goal as you have defined it and on schedule. Step Five: Organize the list into a planPAGE 18

Organize your list by priority and sequence. Take a few minutes to decide what you need to do first and what you can do later. Decide what has to be done before something else and what needs to be done afterwards. Even better, lay out your plan visually, in the form of a series of boxes and circles on a sheet of paper, with lines and arrows showing the relationship of each task to each other task. You’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to achieve your goal when you break it down into individual tasks

First, I began to realize that rampant drunken sex was fun, but not very fulfil ing. And it wasn’t exactly affecting the other areas of my life in a healthy manner. I was required to let up and evaluate myself, to question why I was sacrificing so much time and effort for superficial pleasures. The second thing that happened was I grew a reputation local y for my exploits. Soon men whom I had never met were emailing me asking if they could come hang out with me, to see how I interacted with women, to watch me in action. It was weird at first. But then I decided, sure, why not, just buy my drinks or pay me a bit on the side.

The first one is a greater social and emotional movement in western culture. There’s a cal for a new masculinity that’s been lacking for generations now. There’s been a void of what men are, what they’re supposed to be, how they’re supposed to behave, and until now no one has moved to fil that void. Cal it over-ambitious, but this book aims to begin fil that void, to help create the future models of masculine behavior: models to be attractive, powerful and in control of your relationships with women and with your life in general.

You don’t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James put it: ‘Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not. ‘Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there . . .’ Everybody in the world is seeking happiness – and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions. It isn’t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. For example, two people may be in the same place, doing the same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money and prestige – and yet one may be miserable and the other happy. Why? Because of a different mental attitude. I have seen just as many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling with their primitive tools in the devastating heat of the tropics as I have seen in air-conditioned offices in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. ‘There is nothing either good or bad,’ said Shakespeare, ‘but thinking makes it so.’ Abe Lincoln once remarked that ‘most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.’ He was right. I saw a vivid illustration of that truth as I was walking up the stairs of the Long Island Railroad station in New York. Directly in front of me thirty or forty crippled boys on canes and crutches were struggling up the stairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was astonished at their laughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of the men in charge of the boys. ‘Oh, yes,’ he said, ‘when a boy realises that he is going to be a cripple for life, he is shocked at first; but after he

I repeated that it was my fault. He exploded again about carelessness in the accounting department. Again I explained it was my fault. He blamed two other people in the office.

According to her concept of the “false hope syndrome,” many individuals are stuck in a cycle in which they have unrealistic expectations about accomplishing their goals. They tend to be wrong about the speed, amount, ease, and consequences of their attempts.[16] They try, fail, brood over it, process it, and try again, but with the same unrealistic expectations, which guarantees yet another failure.

It’s illogical to quit because during 3 months you’ve lost just 10 pounds instead of 20. Yet, that’s precisely what many people do. They assume that since things didn’t go exactly as planned, they failed. Then they get frustrated, turn to junk food to reassure themselves, and a few weeks later, the 10 pounds they’ve lost are back.

In an effort to create a positive, stress-free environment, I sidestepped the difficult but necessary part of being a boss: telling people clearly and directly when their work wasn’t good enough.

“Bob.” Bob was one of those instantly likeable people who make going to work a pleasure. He was a kind, funny, caring, and supportive colleague. What’s more, he came to me with a stellar résumé and great references. He seemed to be an A-plus hire, and I was thrilled to have him. There was just one problem: his work was terrible. He lost my confidence shortly after we hired him. He’d been working for weeks on a document to explain that Juice allowed people to create Excel spreadsheets that updated automatically.

It’s brutally hard to tell people when they are screwing up. You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings; that’s because you’re not a sadist. You don’t want that person or the rest of the team to think you’re a jerk. Plus, you’ve been told since you learned to talk, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.” Now all of a sudden it’s your job to say it.

I’VE WRITTEN THIS BOOK WITH the end user—you—in mind. What I have learned not only from my own experiences but also from coaching leaders is that, no matter how supportive the environment, bosses often feel alone. They feel ashamed that they’re not doing a good job, sure that everyone else is doing better, and thus unable or afraid to seek help. But of course no boss is perfect. What drives my mission to share the concepts and methods presented here is the desire to help you avoid making the mistakes I made. That is why I tell so many personal stories.

What should a boss say then? But it’s no better when the problem is really simple and obvious. Why doesn’t the person already know it’s a problem? Do I actually have to say it? Am I too nice? Am I too mean? All these questions loom so large that people often forget they need to solicit guidance from others, and encourage it between them.

Many managers are perpetually frustrated that it seems harder than it should be to get things done. We just doubled the size of the team, but the results are not twice as good. In fact, they are worse. What happened? Sometimes things move too slowly: the people who work for me would debate forever if I let them. Why can’t they make a decision? But other times things move too fast: we missed our deadline because the team was totally unwilling to do a little planning—they insisted on just firing willy-nilly, no ready, no aim! Why can’t they think before they act? Or they seem to be on automatic pilot: they are doing exactly the same thing this quarter that they did last quarter, and they failed last quarter. Why do they expect the results to be different?

establishing a trusting relationship with each person who reports directly to you. If you lead a big organization, you can’t have a relationship with everyone; but you can really get to know the people who report directly to you. Many things get in the way, though: power dynamics first and foremost, but also fear of conflict, worry about the boundaries of what’s appropriate or “professional,” fear of losing credibility, time pressure.

Nevertheless, these relationships are core to your job. They determine whether you can fulfill your three responsibilities as a manager: 1) to create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction; 2) to understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredom and keep the team cohesive; and 3) to drive results collaboratively. If you think that you can do these things without strong relationships, you are kidding yourself. I’m not saying that unchecked power, control, or authority can’t work. They work especially well in a baboon troop or a totalitarian regime. But if you’re reading this book, that’s not what you’re shooting for.

You strengthen your relationships by learning the best ways to get, give, and encourage guidance; by putting the right people in the right roles on your team; and by achieving results collectively that you couldn’t dream of individually. Of course, there can be a vicious cycle between your responsibilities and your relationships, too. When you fail to give people the guidance they need to succeed in their work, or put people into roles they don’t want or aren’t well-suited for, or push people to achieve results they feel are unrealistic, you erode trust.

It turns out that when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to 1) accept and act on your praise and criticism; 2) tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well; 3) engage in this same behavior with one another, meaning less pushing the rock up the hill again and again; 4) embrace their role on the team; and 5) focus on getting results.

Why “candor”? The key to getting everyone used to being direct when challenging each other (and you!) is emphasizing that it’s necessary to communicate clearly enough so that there’s no room for interpretation, but also humbly. I chose “candor” instead of “honesty” because there’s not much humility in believing that you know the truth.

Their first assignment would be to cut a 100-carat diamond into a pair of one-of-a-kind earrings. “Who could buy such large jewels?” the diamond cutters wanted to know. I explained they were a gift from a Saudi sheikh to his wife, who was having twins. What did I know about using lasers to cut diamonds? I promised to take them to Israel to see the latest technology, which was still less efficient than the old copper disks they used. They wanted to learn English. I promised to teach them myself.

You can set yourself up for a failure due to low self-esteem. It can result in self-sabotaging behaviors, such as: - not trying hard enough (after all, you don’t believe you’ll succeed, so what’s the point of doing your best?), - exhibiting doubt (who’s going to date you, invest in your business, or hire you, if you send unconscious signals of uncertainty?), - giving up at the first sign of trouble (why fight, if you already decided that you’d most likely fail?), - creating situations or excuses that set a person up for a failure (like a student who parties the night before an important exam). It’s common for a person suffering from a lack of confidence to invent insignificant problems so they can have an excuse not to face the big ones.

In contrast, a defensive pessimist will: - envision a bad performance — and then research every single possible question they might be asked and prepare a solid answer for each one; - leave to go to the interview an hour sooner, so even if there’s a gigantic traffic, jam they’ll still get there on time; - ensure that they feel well and look good by paying close attention to healthy nutrition, exercise, and getting sufficient sleep prior to the job interview.

It takes a lot of practice to adapt this strategy if you’ve been a pessimist for a long time, so start small and stay patient. The process comes down to three steps: 1. Shifting your locus of control — the extent to which you believe you can control events that affect you[26] — from external to internal. In other words, take responsibility for your life instead of blaming everybody but you for the failure, and admit that you’ve achieved success thanks to your efforts, not through luck. We’ll talk about locus of control in more detail later in this book. 2. Slowly stretching your comfort zone. Start with easy tasks within your comfort zone and take it from there. A string of wins — even if they’re tiny — will help you build positive momentum and develop the belief that things generally turn out okay. 3. Reframing. Optimists are masterful at changing the meaning of their failures. Consequently, they don’t take them personally and maintain high confidence in themselves. For example, if they don’t perform well during a job interview, they’ll consider it a lesson that they need to better prepare for their next interview or they’ll simply tell themselves that if they didn’t perform well, it was probably because subconsciously they knew it wasn’t the right company for them.

As much as I value being reasonable when setting new goals, I don’t set limits for myself as to what I can achieve given enough time — and neither should you. This is a crucial tool to escape self-imposed mediocrity that is caused by the erroneous belief that you aren’t the master of your own destiny.

Next, write down a list of past failures that you blame on external factors. Try to find at least one action of yours that might have contributed to the situation, so you can see that it wasn’t entirely caused by something beyond your control.

Now, please note that I don’t want you to beat yourself up for every failure. It’s important to exhibit self-compassion instead of self-guilt. Also, please note that you shouldn’t take ownership of a failure that clearly wasn’t caused by you. If your ex left you because they found somebody else, don’t shop for pain by thinking about what you did wrong, because maybe you didn’t do anything wrong. Things like that do happen.

last step is simple, but can produce profound changes: eliminate phrases like “I have no choice” from your vocabulary. Instead of saying that you have no choice, you can say, “I don’t like my choices, but I choose to...” Maybe your options aren’t ideal, but you can always choose something — and making this choice shows that you assume responsibility for the situation. In the end, remember that not making a choice is also a choice — and often, the worst one.

Shift your locus of control from external to internal by: increasing your awareness of previous experiences over which you exerted control; finding at least one past action of yours that could have contributed to a failure you believed was caused by external factors; coming up with choices and options that will affect a current or future challenge (to remind yourself that you do have some control); and lastly, eliminate phrases like “I have no choice” from your vocabulary.

“Bring your whole self to work.”

When they become a boss, some people consciously or unconsciously begin to feel they’re better or smarter than the people who work for them. That attitude makes it impossible to be a kick-ass boss; it just makes people want to kick your ass.

Just remember that being a boss is a job, not a value judgment.

Challenging others and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) you care enough to point out both the things that aren’t going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you’re wrong and that you are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made. But because challenging often involves disagreeing or saying no, this approach embraces conflict rather than avoiding it.

Instead, offer to help fix the problem. But don’t pretend it isn’t a problem just to try to make somebody feel better.
